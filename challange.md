Challenge
=========

Build and run the application.
Copy contacts.csv into your home folder.

The project owner creates the following user story:

    As a petclinic user I want to maintain a list of pet owners in MS Excel and export
    this list as 'contacts.csv' file into my Windows user folder. The PetClinic
    shall import all owners from this contacts.csv file on startup.

Compile a list questions you would like to ask the project owner to further refine this user story.

Implement a prototype of this feature based on your assumptions.
